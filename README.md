# Shop Shop Redux

## Object
refactor the e-commerce platform to use Redux

## Features
- [x] The website uses Redux store to manage global state.
- [x] It uses the Redux provider.
- [x] The app passes reducers to a Redux store.
- [x] The app accesses the data from the Redux store and uses the Redux to dispatch actions.
- [x] Can create, update, and delete data in my database by POST, PUT and DELETE routes.

## Technologies
Node.js, express, mongodb, mongoose, react, redux, consurrently, jwt, graphql

## Reflection
This is my first time to adapt a new technology completely by myself. Reading documentation and understanding how to implement it in the coding takes time and needs methods to debug and resolve the issue.
